Project Overview
This project focuses on applying CSS styling to the webpage created in the previous HTML project. The design is guided by a Figma file, where all the visual elements have been specified. My goal is to bring the webpage to life with a beautiful, professional look in line with the design specifications provided.

Key Tasks:
CSS Layout: Implement the layout for each section (header, main content, footer) based on the Figma design.

Colors: Use color values from the Figma file to style backgrounds, text, and borders.
Images & Icons: Ensure all images and icons match the Figma design and are positioned properly.
